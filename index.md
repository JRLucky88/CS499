### Self-Assessment
Throughout my journey at SNHU, I have acquired and honed a myriad of skills that will undoubtedly empower my career. Each class presented unique challenges and enriching experiences, significantly contributing to my growth. Among these were courses in computer graphics, data structures with pie chart displays, and MongoDB, all of which played a crucial role in my development. I successfully achieved all five course outcomes. 

* The first outcome involved designing and evaluating computing solutions that address specific problems through algorithmic principles and industry-standard practices, all while carefully managing design trade-offs.
* The second outcome demonstrated my ability to leverage innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing to create solutions that deliver substantial value and meet industry goals.
* I also achieved the outcome related to producing professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and tailored to diverse audiences.
* In addition, I developed a security mindset, anticipating adversarial exploits in software architectures to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure the privacy and security of data and resources, employing best practices of secure coding across all my artifacts.
* Finally, I embraced strategies that foster collaborative environments, enabling diverse audiences to contribute to organizational decision-making in computer science, as demonstrated by my work with GitHub repositories and pages.
#### Team Environments
Throughout my educational journey, I have valued both independence and collaboration, which have significantly shaped my growth. A pivotal experience at SNHU was the course CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle, where I explored the intricacies of the SDLC through the lenses of project managers, developers, and testers.
The group projects we undertook truly transformed my understanding. Immersed in agile methodologies, each of us played distinct roles, deepening our teamwork and adaptability. Utilizing tools like Azure not only enhanced our technical skills but also connected us to the realities of software development.
These lessons have inspired me to approach challenges with creativity and resilience. I now see every project as an opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to something greater, building lasting connections and driving meaningful change.
#### Communication with Stakeholders
Through my experience, I've gained valuable insights into effective communication with both team members and stakeholders. A pivotal class at SNHU focused on the agile environment and clarified the distinct roles within it. This course emphasized the critical role of the project manager, who primarily drives communication between stakeholders and developers, ensuring transparency and collaboration throughout the project cycle.
#### Data Structures and Algorithms
Throughout my educational journey, I have gained significant insights into data structures and algorithms, particularly during my coursework in CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design. In this class, we delved into advanced algorithmic strategies and rigorously assessed various data structures. We worked extensively with hash tables, binary search trees, and vectors, gaining a deep understanding of each one's unique strengths. This course not only equipped me with technical skills but also sharpened my ability to choose the most effective data structure for a given context, empowering me to tackle complex problems with confidence.
#### Software Engineering and Databases
Throughout my educational journey, I have engaged deeply with database management through courses in SQL and MongoDB. A standout experience was in CS-340 Client/Server Development, where I actively applied fundamental database concepts using CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations to manipulate databases effectively. Additionally, in CS-465 Full Stack Development, I mastered the art of building a full stack application, seamlessly integrating databases with robust coding practices. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also equipped me to develop sophisticated applications with a strong foundation in database principles.
#### Security
Security stands as a fundamental pillar of computer science, and it plays a vital role in every aspect of coding. Throughout my education, I immersed myself in the intricacies of security and the myriad vulnerabilities that can arise. While I took several courses on the topic, the most impactful was CS-305 Software Security. This course equipped me with the essential skills to develop robust, secure code while adhering to established security testing protocols. I gained in-depth knowledge of encryption and decryption techniques and became proficient in using various tools to identify vulnerabilities. My education has instilled in me a strong commitment to building secure systems that safeguard against potential threats.

### Software Design and Engineering
#### Briefly describe the artifact
I selected the artifact from CS 330, which focused on graphics and visualization. This project allowed me to immerse myself in the intricacies of manipulating a 3D scene by integrating diverse shapes, vibrant textures, realistic materials, and dynamic lighting to create an authentic representation of real-world objects. I found great satisfaction in bringing my vision to life through this project and am eager to explore additional enhancements that could further elevate its visual impact and overall experience.
#### Enhancements 
Prior to the recent enhancements, the environment was limited to just three light sources, resulting in several textures failing to render correctly on their corresponding objects. To address these issues, I thoroughly repaired the underlying code and reworked the textures to significantly improve the manipulation of light sources. This included adjustments to both diffuse and specular lighting, which effectively highlighted the distinctive effects of these parameters on various materials. Additionally, I introduced a fourth light source, further enriching the overall atmosphere and depth of the scene.

### Algorithms and Data Structure
#### Briefly describe the artifact
The artifact I chose for this category is a project from my CS-340 course at SNHU that highlights CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality. This assignment connects users with animals skilled in various rescue categories, such as water rescues and disaster tracking. Upon logging in, users find a well-organized table showcasing animals and their unique attributes, enhancing user experience and aiding informed decision-making in critical situations. This project exemplifies how database management can effectively support a noble cause.
#### Enhancements 
Imagine easily identifying the best candidates for breeding programs to enhance biodiversity. Previously, our pie chart's limited dropdown menu restricted our insights. By applying HTML coding skills, I expanded these options to include vital factors like age and sex, streamlining the selection process. 
This improvement not only demonstrates our commitment to responsible breed management but also positions us as leaders in animal conservation. Let’s embrace these enhancements for a better future for our wildlife!

### Databases
#### Briefly describe the artifact
The artifact I selected for the database category is an exemplary project from my CS-340 course at SNHU, from above. This project is not just a technical endeavor; it represents an innovative approach to leveraging technology for a noble cause. With its engaging interface and valuable content, it's a remarkable example of how database management can make a real difference in our understanding of animal rescue capabilities.
#### Enhancements 
Throughout this journey, I successfully created a database from a CSV file and transformed it into a JSON database, executing complex queries and updating data with confidence. I view this experience as a significant achievement, particularly since I had never created a database from scratch on my own before. In previous classes, databases were provided, so the process of building a complete and functional database using the appropriate software marks a major milestone in my personal and professional growth.
